This section is dedicated to the anatomy of an *Exalted* character. For clarity, you can find snippets of an example character creation to better illustrate the core concepts. There are infinite ways of creating a character. You can draw inspiration from a certain piece of media you like, directly transpose yourself or what you'd like to be, or even just cobble together a bunch traits to make a Frankenstein character that you might find very fun to roleplay as. 

>Mike always loved old, black and white Samurai movies. So he decides that his character, Naishin, is gonna be a katana wielding warrior that swore loyalty to his lord: his father Munishi. A natural talent with the blade, Naishin was an excellent swordsman but didn't care too much about his father's ideals of Honor, Justice and Sobriety, spending his nights in sake houses and women's beds. When the raiding clan of the Many-Eyed-Ravens attacked his village, Naishin was eager to finally put his skills to the real test. Much to his horror, the raiders pierced the village's defences in less than an hour. As many of his childhood friends died at his side, Naishin ran for his life, leaving his father alone to defend his birthplace, dying in the process. In the aftermath of the battle, Naishin returned to the village that once adored him, to find a broken community of people who almost lynched him for desertion. Now Naishin roams the world hoping to rid himself of the unbearable guilty that haunts him.

# Statistics
Statistics, often reduced to stats, define your character. In *Exalted* stats represent both your character physical qualities and their mental profile. This allows the same stats to be used in wildly different scenarios where your character is put to the same narrative type of stress. As an example surviving a big old hammer blow to the head and not crying over a dead friend while undercover are both **Determination** [[Checks]], despite them being very different feats. 

## Precision
Precision is your character's deduction skills, cleanness of movement and mental clarity all baked into one. 

Precise characters tend to be meticulous, organized and very effective. They destroy their opponents not by brute force but by applying pressure where they are weakest. They are often able to see things that other miss in the clutter of battle or parties, and often tend to wait before the time is right to strike. At their best they are masters at work, talent made manifest.

Precise characters have the awful habit of being prideful, as being better than anyone at your job can do. They also tend to expect the same level of excellence they embody from their party. At their worst they will turn this unmeetable requirements onto themselves, being unable to the legend they forged for themselves.

Precision is used for [[Checks]] where your character must simply *be good* at something. Deduction, lock-picking, playing chess or cutting a falling leaf before it touches the ground. 

## Passion
Passion is your character's quickness of acting, brutality of violence and intensity of pleasure. 

Passionate characters tend to be charming, expressive and ambitious. They know what the want, who stands before them, and will often not think on how to defeat them. Passion is your character's ability to impose their will onto others, may it be by grabbing their by their heart, or yanking it out of their chest. They feel emotions like a fire in their chest that must get out, and will make sure others feel the same heat. At their best they are amazing lovers, breath-taking artists and the most deadly assassins. 

However, feeling so intensely can cause them to ignore reason. Hot headed and quick to anger, they tend to think twice, if at all. Used to getting their way by means of lips and dagger, they can be petty, spoiled, or otherwise easy to bruise. At their worst their bruised ego could lead them to seek self-destructive pleasure. 

Passion is used for [[Checks]] where your character is calling upon their *inner fire*. Quickly reacting before you set a trap off. Seduction and performance. Artistry and driving a short sword through a neck are all moments where your character's Passion is put to the test.

## Depth
Depth is your character's complexity of mind, their connection to higher powers and the darkness that lurks below.

Deep characters arrive in both the meek silent and the loud snob variety. Whatever facade they may project, nobody truly knows what's going inside their skull, often not even themselves. They are often resourceful and reliable, although they surprise the party when they show how truly capable and powerful they can be. At their best, they draw upon forgotten knowledge that nobody expected them to have, or reveal a point of view that's truly alien to normal. 

Having such a bottomless lake for a mind can cause one to loose themselves in it. Deep characters often run the risk of being too secretive, untrustworthy if not straight up unrelatable. At their worst they loose all contact to reality, their loved ones, and themselves. 

Depth is used for [[Checks]] where your character must know something others do not. Recalling if you saw a certain artefact, knowing forgotten lore you absolutely should not. Channelling your inner darkness to torture a prisoner. All of these are moments where your character must look in itself to find answers. 

## Determination
Determination is your character's mettle, unsinkability and physical strength.

Determined characters can be as dull as rocks or as tragic as ancient heroes, but both will rather die than abandon their goals and ideals. They cannot be convinced to back down, neither by blade or words or poison or magic. They often choose the most obvious solution to any problem: if a door is locked they won't try to pick the lock or lie their way inside. After a few seconds there will simply be no door left. At their best they are Unstoppables juggernauts that stand tall when everybody else has bent the knees, lighthouses that endure wave crash after wave crashing replying "is that it?" to sea. 

However, determination can quickly turn to stubbornness. Determined characters run the risk of being too fixated on details, or not knowing when to cut your losses. At their worst they can sacrifice themselves for ideals and people that no longer care about them. 

Determination is used for [[Checks]] where your character's spirit is tested. Surviving poison or being terrified, breaking someone's back in half, climbing a castle wall during a thunderstorm while boiling acid is getting poured on you. 

## Mischief
Mischief is your character's whimsical joy, unexplainable luck and chaotic urges.

Mischievous characters are adventurous and content. They see colors brighter than others but are more than happy to try and show them just how magical our world is, even the parts that most would consider dull. Although not often described as "smart", they tend to be crafty, tricky, and very hard to catch. At their best, which is when whatever problem the party currently has aligns with their momentary distraction, they can cause chaos even in the most organized of enemies, or bring together the most hated enemies. 

Having a feeling attention span and essentially zero discipline, can lead mischievous characters down the dark path. When nothing else other than your own entertainment matters, simple childish antics can turn into twisted and cruel jokes. At their worst they could loose all sense of morality and reason for a quick laugh.

Mischief is used for [[Checks]] that require your character to lie trough their teeth, surprise people or just being plain lucky. Convincing someone that they are actually a bear, freeing yourself from restrains that affect body and mind, guessing what color someone is thinking of. All moments where Mischief is king.

**Character creation: balancing stats**
At character creation you can assign stats however you want, but the sum of them must be 5. As you can immagine, this is quite a low score, meaning a that a fully balanced character can only have +1 on every stat. The reason is that each stat can actually range from +6 to -6. We encourage specialization in a few stats (especially since negative stats can be a positive assets, as described in [[Checks#Conflicts_Checks|Conflicts]]). Our suggested stat line is as follow: +6,+3, 0, -2, -4. Assign these numbers to the relevant stats of your character.

>Mike ponders for a while, and decides to assign the stats as follow. Precision is gonna be Naishin's primary stat, to represent his talent with the honourable katana and his pursuit of greater skills to avenge his cowardice. This frightfulness, Mike decides, is gonna be portrayed by Naishin's abysmal Determination. His recklessness will earn him a good score in Passion. Depth is gonna be low since Naishin isn't particularly complicated character, being quite extroverted and honest. Finally Mischief is gonna be neutral since he's not looking to cause any more trouble. 
>
>In the end Naishin's stats are gonna be: Precision +6, Passion +3, Mischief 0, Depth -2, Determination -4

**Passive score:** the number of each stat is called **active score** (AC) because it's used on [[Checks]] your character is doing. On the other hand, for situations where an NPC is being tested against your character, your stat determines the **Threshold** for such Check. This number is essentially how resilient your character is in that stat's area of influence. More details in the [[Checks]] chapter, so far it's just important to remember that each stat also has what's called a **passive score** that's calculated as follows: **stats AC + 10**. 

>Naishin's passive scores are: Precision 16, Passion 13, Mischief 10, Depth 8, Determination 6
# Traits
Traits are ways to make a character's backstory, race, talents, ecc ecc, help during gameplay. A trait can quite literally be anything as long as it's important to that particular character. They can be the character's past before becoming an adventurer, like *Sailor, Soldier, Farmer*, their race *Human, Elf, Dwarf*, some particular hobby they posses *Musician, Painter, Athlete*, a certain vice *Gambler, Alcoholic, Petty Thief*. Again, **anything** can be a trait if the player so wishes. 

**Fair Play:** There's no comprehensive list of trait (although some settings have suggestion lists), so give trait to your heart's content, but it's considered bad practice to just give your character Traits for no reason other than to help you win encounters more easily. While it's alright to have one Trait *Excellent Swordsman* or *Superhuman Endurance* per character, having ten traits that all amount to *I'm better than anyone else at everything* can be unfun. Of course there are no hard and fast rules, if the party and the Director are ok, but it's up to the Director's **discretion** whether or not to remove some Traits to your character.

Traits are divided into **Minor Traits** and **Major Traits**. As imaginable, Minor Traits depicts minor aspects of a character (but not trivial), while Major Traits are essentially character defining. Each character can have as much as 10 Minor Traits and 2 Major Traits, but when creating a new a character it's advised to not go above 5 minor ones and 1 or even 0 major traits. Each minor trait gives a Bonus Die during [[Checks]], while major ones gives two. More can be found about them in the [[Checks]] chapter.

Traits can and should be gained and lost during the campaign. Of course Minor Traits should be more volatile and can be earned or lost with less intense actions and decisions compared to Major Traits. An example, if your character spectacularly looses during a swordfight (but doesn't die, obviously), you or the Director might decide to give him the *Scarred* Minor Trait. Loosing or gaining a Major Trait require more thought and effort, and it's advised to talk to the Director about it. You can and are encouraged to ask the Director to gain or loose a Trait as result of an encounter or  breakthrough in the story, but remember that everything is at his **discretion** and can refuse your suggestion.

>For Naishin, Mike chooses the Major Trait *Guilty: act of cowardice*. He could have very well be more specific like *Guilty: lost father due to act of cowardice* or the like, you can be as precise or as vague as you wish. As for minor Traits he chooses *Katana Expert* but will refrain from giving his character any more "straight upgrades" Trait. So he goes on to add *Prideful* and *Drinker* to give Naishin more narrative hooks from which to play off of during gameplay. Lastly Mike chooses to add *Noble* to summarize his wealthy and lavish early life.
