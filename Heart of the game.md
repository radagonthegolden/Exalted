*Exalted* is a game of abstraction. It seeks to free the table top RPG experience from the shackles of combat, making deception, investigation, arguing and more just as exciting and rich as beating the shit out of each other. 

*Exalted* puts a lot of emphasis on freedom, interpretation and imagination. Spells do not have effects in this, just names that the player must interpret to create their own magic. Players can even draw bonus dices from brilliant interpretation of the scene, movie actor tier roleplaying, or simply making the Director's (the dungeon master) laugh. 

In every TTRPG the Dungeon Master is the judge, jury and executioner of the story, doubly so in *Exalted*. The rules allow for boundless freedom to create interesting stories and express yourself in your characters. However, such true freedom can lead to boring stories with no stakes. Often times you'll see the keywords **at the Director's discretion**, or alternatively that some sort of condition must be **reasonably** met. You'll find it in rules that, for the sake of creativity, are intentionally left vague and up to interpretation. *Exalted* is all about interpretation and inspiration, but as in any TTRPG players **must** respect the Director's decision and remember that a strict one is just trying their best to write and interesting story. It's never their goal to stand between your character and their objectives.
