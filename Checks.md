**Checks** are the bread and butter of *Exalted*. The moment your character tries to pick a lock, persuade a guard, remain hidden or detect if someone is lying they are required to perform a Check. The most common way a Check is triggered is when the Director presents the players with a problem, they elaborate a solution that might or might not be optimal, then they tell the player to do a Check on a particular Stat and Symbol. The player in question throws two six sided dices  and add the relevant Stat. If the result is **equal or higher** than a predetermined amount, called the Check's **Difficulty**, they succeed. Otherwise they don't. These 2D6 are called **Base Dices**.

>After creating Naishin, Mike finally starts to play *Exalted*. During one of the first encounters the party meet a fellow swordsman wants to rob them blind. Naishin tries to prove to the thief that they wouldn't be an easy match by launching a pebble behind him and slashing it with his Katana before it lands. An act that for sure would deter the swordsman from fighting. 
>
>The Director accepts this as a reasonable way to solve the problem. They tell Mike to perform a Clock Check, which falls under Precision. So to do so Mike throws two dice, resulting in 2 and 5, then adds his precision: 2+5+6 = 13. The Director decided not to reveal the Difficulty for this Check, which was 10, but tells Mike that Naishin managed to scare the bandit off. The party can continue on its marry way. 

To understand Checks one must first be comfortable with Symbols and their meanings. You might have noticed that in your character sheet, near each Stat, there are two circles with drawings inside. Those are the Symbols.
### Symbols
Symbols are essentially sub categories to divide the stats in. Think of *Athletics* or *Arcana* in other games. The main difference is that in *Exalted* each time you make a [[Check]] you **must** use a symbol. There is no such a thing a *just* a Precision check, it must use one of its symbols. Just like the stats they are thematic.

#### Precision
**Lantern:** lantern is used when the mental acuity aspect of Precision is used. Seeing things for how they really are, seeking solutions and order in the chaos.

**Clock:** clock is used when precision of movement is required. It can be lock picking, disarming a bomb, or even driving a rapier between armor scales. 

#### Passion
**Sword:** sword is the aggressiveness side of Passion. Quickness of reflexes, slashing and murdering, or simply shouting so loud that your opponents flee in terror. 

**Wine:** wine is used when pleasure and artistry are involved. Seduction, performance and in general feeling all that human experience has to offer is where wine is at home.

#### Depth
**Star:** star is your connection to higher powers. It's used when dealing with ancient gods, unknowable intelligences or otherwise knowing things that elude most people. 

**Thorns:** thorns is the dark side of your intellect. It's used when knowledge of pain, poison and corruption is needed, whether it's detecting such threats or employing them. 

#### Determination
**Thunder:** thunder is loud and thunder is strong. Brute force, shock and tremors. Thunder is used for breaking things and people, for feats of intense mental and physical strength. 

**Hearth:** hearth persists. Hearth is used when resisting, enduring, surviving. It's used to repel attacks to the spirit and the body.

#### Mischief
**Mask:** mask can never be trusted. Mask is used when presenting yourself as something you're not, despite all the evidence against you. Desperate deception, bizarre logic and frankly stupid attempts at convincing people are where Mask shines.

**Butterfly:** butterfly is chaos incarnate. It's used when doing things that defy earthly reasoning. Trials and tribulations that require blind luck or  the favour of the gods to be passed.

# Bonus Dices
A core concept of *Exalted* are Bonus Dice. Considering that a quite easy Check can have as high a Difficulty as 10, using only the Base Dices and your relevant Stat seems unfair. But Fret not! There are many, many ways a player can improve their chances to perform a Check, Bonus Dice being one of them. Each time a rule states that a character gets a Bonus Dice for a certain Check, that character will roll 1D6 more than the usual two for that Check. 

Having a Minor Trait that gives a character a **reasonable** advantage on the narrative obstacle that's causing the Check, the player earns a Bonus Die on that Check, two if the Trait was a Major Trait. The same Trait cannot be used again until the next Scene. 

>**Example:** When trying to bribe a wealthy noble for access to his castle, Naishin earns himself a Bonus Die thanks to his *Noble* Trait. The *Coward* Trait may give him a Bonus Die to fleeing attempts or Checks where his reaction time to some sort of physical harm is being tested, ecc ecc. It's up to the Director whether or not a certain Trait earns you a Bonus Die or not. 

Players may also gain up to two Bonus Dices from the Scene itself. To do so the player must present an interesting, surprising or just plain funny solution to the problem that is causing the Check. This could be an approach that the Director considers smart or crafty, or maybe using a certain detail that proves the player is truly immersing in the story. Scene's Bonus Dices can also be given by the Director to reward role play or plot shakes up. At last anything that **reasonably** helps a character can earn you Bonus Dices. Two Dices can be earned by exploiting two different elements of the Scene or even just one that the Director considers to be exceptionally smart. However, it's always up to the **Director's discretion** how many Bonus Dices to give, if any.

>**Example:** If Naishin had to persuade a mercenary that he knows is very attached to her daughter into helping him and his party, he might bring her up saying that she should fight for her sake as well. This smart exploit of plot points earns Mike a Bonus Die when doing such Check. If Naishin knew that the mercenary to be quite prideful, he could say something along the lines of *Come with us, unless you're not so sure of your skills...*, stroking her ego. This would certainty earn yet another Bonus Die. Now no more can be gained from the Scene itself.

>**Example:** if Naishin's party were to capture a group of four assassins sent to kill the party by an unknown individual, he could try to intimidate them into revealing the name of their sender. If Mike were to say: *I tell them that whoever talks first gets out alive, the others will have their throat cut in a single swipe!* the Director could reasonably give him two Bonus Dices for such a creative approach to the problem.

## Malus Dices
Some rules will give Checks **Malus Dices**. As you can immagine Malus Dices are D6s that get rolled after the Base Dices (+ any Bonus Dices). Their result is then **subtracted** from the total result. 

>**Trick:** if you have two differently coloured sets of D6s you can roll all dices (Base, Bonus and Malus) at the same instead of having to roll first Base + Bonus and then Malus. Just make sure to keep track of which are Malus Dices. This might save a lot of time over the course of an entire campaign.

The same way Traits and the Scene can give up to 4D6 Bonus Dice, they can give a character 4D6 of Malus Dices. When to give Malus Dice from these two sources is up to the Director's discretion, as with anything else, but it can be a touchy subject. No player can complain if they gain a Malus Dice from an very clear rule, but they may argue that a Trait the Director thinks is rowing against them isn't actually. There is no correct way to handle this. Some campaigns' tone may call for a brutal Director that gives Malus Dices left and right, some may never give them at all from a Trait or Scene element. 

>**House rule:** we advice newer players to do this. The Director can *suggest* that a certain Trait or Scene element should give a character Malus Dices, however **the player can always refuse them**. The player themselves can choose to earn Malus Dices, these are always accepted (that is, as long as it makes sense in the narrative). To Encourage fair play, the Director should increase the narrative reward from a successful Check done with Malus Dices that the player accepted or gave themselves. 
## Symbol statuses
there are conditions like *Charmed, Frightened* or *Stunned* in *Exalted*, at least not in the rules. The way status effects are handled all revolves around Symbols and their own statues. A Symbol can be:
- **Snuffed:** that aspect of the character's personality is completely suppressed. They cannot willingly do Check of that symbol. If required to do a Check using this symbol by another rule, they gain 4D6 Malus Dices. 
- **Overshadowed:** the character isn't focusing on that aspect of their personality at the time. Checks using this Symbol have 2D6 Malus Dices. 
- **Clear:** this aspect of the character is neither dominating nor being silenced. No particular rules. 
- **Bright:** this side of the character is currently dominating their mind. Other Symbols are Overshadowed, but Checks for this Symbol have 2D6 Bonus Dices. When a Symbol is Brightened while another is alright Bright, the old one gets overshadowed just like all the others. 
- **Exalted:** for the time being, this character IS this particularly aspect of their personality, they absolutely cannot think about anything else at the moment. Other Symbols are Snuffed, but Checks done with Symbol have 4D6 Bonsu Dices. Whenever another Symbol gets Exalted, this one gets Snuffed alongside all the others. 

>Later in the campaign, Naishin crosses blades with a Succubus, a particularly alluring demon that uses her unnatural charm as a weapon. After a failed Thunder Check, Naishin's Wine Symbol gets **Exalted**, to represent how his entire mind is now focused on thoughts of pleasure and lust. Until the condition ends Naishin won't even be able to try to attack the demon. 

A Symbol being Bright or Exalted, while certainly limiting, can be used as an opportunity to turn the tide of battle in your favour, as it means actions done in accord with the condition are much easier to perform.

>While charmed by the Succubus, Naishin is unable to attack it with his Katana as that would be a Clock Check which is currently Snuffed. However, taking by heat of love, Naishin tries to seduce the Succubus. With an already decent Passion, and all the bonuses of an Exalted Wine Symbol, the Samurai manages to charm the demon back. Voras, one of Naishin's party members, then attacks the Succubus with his axe, causing it to perform an Heart Check that it automatically looses. The charm ends on the Succubus and subsequently on Naishin as well. 
>
>This way, Mike managed to make the best out of a bad situation.

# Clashes
A Check's Difficulty is meant to represent how hard a specific task is. Most of the obstacles players will face during gameplay will be passive props: picking a lock, scaling a wall, finding a hidden clue. All these Checks will have a static Difficulty determined by the Director. 

However, in some cases the force the players will be fighting against is gonna be more proactive. Most of the times this will be another character that's actively focusing on opposing the players. In these situations the Director might call for a **Clash**. Clashes are a subset of Checks, so every rule that mentions a Check applies, where instead of a player rolling against a set numeric Difficulty, another character will roll as well. The result of the second character (including the relevant Stat) is gonna be the Difficulty number the character that initiated the Clash will have to match to win. 

During Clashes both characters can gain Bonus Dices for Traits or Scene elements, as well as any other bonuses they are entitled to in a normal Check.

Note that Clashes usually involve different Symbols and Stat. If a player is trying to steal a key from a guard, the player will roll on Clock while the guard will roll on Lantern. If an NPC is trying to poison a player, that will be a Thorn roll against a Heart roll.
